## About the dataset
The dataset comprises essential details like car name, year, present price, kilometers driven, and more. The dataset contains information on approximately 301 cars sold by CarDekho, providing a comprehensive set of features, including fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner details.

## Project Overview
 In this project, we aim to predict the selling prices of cars using the CarDekho dataset, which comprises essential details like car name, year, present price, kilometers driven, and more. The dataset contains information on approximately 301 cars sold by CarDekho, providing a comprehensive set of features, including fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner details.

Success in this case study is determined by achieving R-squared and Adjusted R-squared scores both exceeding 0.8, signifying the effectiveness of the predictive model.

You can navigate and understand the project by cloning this repository to your local machine and executing the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script. Dive into the analysis, model results, and diagnostic plots to uncover insights into predicting car selling prices. ðŸš—


## Key Points


1.	`Data Exploration and Analysis`: Conducted thorough data exploration and analysis to gain insights into the data's characteristics, patterns, and relationships. Used appropriate visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand the data better.

2.	`Data Preprocessing`: Cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed the data to make it suitable for modeling. Handled missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
   
3.	`Feature Engineering`: Created new features or transformed existing features to improve model performance and captured relevant information from the data.
   
4.	`Model Selection`: Choosed appropriate machine learning algorithms or statistical models based on the problem type and data characteristics. (Used Linear Regression, OLS)
   
5.	`Model Training and Evaluation`: Splitted the data into training and test sets and trained the model on the training data. Evaluated the model's performance on the test data using relevant evaluation metrics.
   
6.	`Dignostic Plots`: Checked the various assumptions of OLS Model.
   
7.	`Data Visualization`: Used effective data visualizations to communicate insights and model results.
   
8.	`Tunning of the model`: by removing insignificant variables  (with P-value>0.5).


## Model Result
|S.no|Model|R2 Value| Adjusted R2 Value|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Intial Model|0.84|0.83|
|2|Tuned Model|0.93|0.93|

   
### `Overall there is an increase in R2 and Adjusted R2 values after Tuning the Model.`
