## About the dataset
The dataset comprises essential details like car name, year, present price, kilometers driven, and more. The dataset contains information on approximately 301 cars sold by CarDekho, providing a comprehensive set of features, including fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner details.

## Project Overview
 In this project, we aim to predict the selling prices of cars using the CarDekho dataset, which comprises essential details like car name, year, present price, kilometers driven, and more. The dataset contains information on approximately 301 cars sold by CarDekho, providing a comprehensive set of features, including fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner details.

Success in this case study is determined by achieving R-squared and Adjusted R-squared scores both exceeding 0.8, signifying the effectiveness of the predictive model.

You can navigate and understand the project by cloning this repository to your local machine and executing the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script. Dive into the analysis, model results, and diagnostic plots to uncover insights into predicting car selling prices. ðŸš—


## Key Points
1. Data Exploration and Analysis: Conducted  exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and processed features for the model.
3. Dignostic Plots: Checking the various assumptions of OLS Model.
4. Model Building: Built a Regression model using linear Regression,OLS.
5. Tunning of the model by removing insignificant variables  (with P-value>0.5).

## Model Result
## `Intial Model`
   - R2 Value : 0.84
   - Adjusted R2 : 0.83
   
## `Tuned Model`
   - R2 Value : 0.93
   - Adjusted R2 : 0.93
   
### `Overall there is an increase in R2 and Adjusted R2 values after Tuning the Model.`
